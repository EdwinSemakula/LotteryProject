# Lottery Project
This project simulates how many attempts it would take to win the lottery as well as how much money would be lost/gained from buying tickets and winnings.
The program allows the user to select their own numbers which will remain the same for every entry, or choose lucky dip which selects random numbers for the user. 
If lucky dip is chosen then the user's numbers are extremely likely change in every entry (chance to repeat on back to back entries but the odds of that are extremely low).
The prize tiers are exactly the same as the UK National Lottery except for the jackpot prize of Â£13 million which is the average amount for winning the lottery over the last 20 years.
